/**
 * You have surely noticed that some additional finer and finest messages appeared in the console in the last example
 * while they did not appear in the code. In fact, finest messages are used to log many of the agent methods defined in
 * MaDKit. And the agent's life cycle is traced at the finer level. So, setting the logger's level to finer, finest or
 * all represents a very easy way of debugging MaDKit agents ! Here, we just set the logger's level to all to show that
 * there are log messages which are displayed whereas there is no explicit code here. notes : - agent's life is composed
 * by the methods : activate(), live() and end(). - the different pauses are only there for you to see the agent's life
 * cycle.
