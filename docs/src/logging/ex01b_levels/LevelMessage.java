/**
 * The main advantage of using the Logger class is that all messages are associated with a level. Indeed, depending on
 * the logging method used, a message will have a particular level. This level will have an impact on how the message is
 * displayed. In this example, we will log two messages with different levels. You will observe that the messages are
 * preceded by their own log level.
